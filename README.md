The dataset includes no metadata or reviews, but only (user,item,rating,timestamp) tuples, having approx. 2.6+ million ratings

The dataset is analyzed using five techniques/algorithms, namely â€“ User-based CF, Item-based CF, SVD, ALS and Popular items, and a hybrid recommender system is proposed, which essentially is an ensemble of top three performing models on the given dataset.
